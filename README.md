# NVD - CVE API


create sapmle.json to store model data - reduce reliance on data from network for testing purpose

check documentation for pagination support 

# notes

The first page should contain:
1. The route path should be /cves/list.
2. Read the API and display its results in a table with a "Total Records" count.
3. Include "Results Per Page" below the table, offering options of "10", "50", and "100",
    with a default selection of "10". Whenever an option is chosen, execute the
    respective API call to retrieve the records.(Good to have)
4. Add server side “Pagination” functionality (Optional - Added advantage)
5. Add server side “sorting” for “Dates” (Optional - Added advantage)
